# Sign-in/Sign-up Authentication using Vite (Frontend) and Node.js with Express (Backend)

A full-stack authentication project built using Vite for the frontend and Node.js with Express for the backend. This project enables user registration and login, with password hashing for secure storage. It utilizes npm modules such as Axios, Mongoose, and Bcrypt.

## Features

- User Registration: Allow users to create an account.
- User Login: Enable users to log in securely.
- Password Hashing: Store passwords securely using Bcrypt.
- RESTful API: Utilize Express to create a RESTful API for user management.
- Database Integration: Store user data in a MongoDB database using Mongoose.

## Technologies Used

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/): A fast, opinionated web dev build tool that serves your code via native ES modules.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): A JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/): A web application framework for building web applications and APIs in Node.js.
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/): A promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/): A NoSQL database for storing user data.
- [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/): An elegant MongoDB object modeling for Node.js.
- [Bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt): A library for hashing and verifying passwords.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your system.
- MongoDB database set up and running.
